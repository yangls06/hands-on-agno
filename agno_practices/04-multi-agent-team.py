# ┃     • P/E and P/B Analysis: AAPL has a relatively high P/B Ratio (43.76),       ┃
# ┃       suggesting an expensive valuation relative to its book value. The P/E     ┃
# ┃       Ratio of 23.54 also indicates a high stock price relative to its          ┃
# ┃       earnings.                                                                 ┃

# ┃     • P/E and P/B Analysis: Lower P/E Ratio (19.54) compared to Apple           ┃
# ┃       highlights more attractive valuation relative to earnings. Meanwhile, the ┃
# ┃       P/B Ratio at 6.19 is reasonable, signaling fair valuation based on the    ┃
